NAME
       rm - remove files or directories

SYNOPSIS
       rm [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       rm removes each specified file.  By default, it does not remove directories.

OPTIONS
       Remove (unlink) the FILE(s).

       -f
              do not tells about nonexistent files

       -r
              remove directories and their contents recursively

       By  default,  rm does not remove directories.  Use the -r option to remove each listed directory, too, along with all of its con‚Äê
       tents.

       Note that if you use rm to remove a file, it might be possible to recover some of its contents, given sufficient expertise and/or time.  For  greater
       assurance that the contents are truly unrecoverable, consider using shred.
